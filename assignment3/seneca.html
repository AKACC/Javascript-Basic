            <h3>Welcome to Seneca College</h3>
            <p>
              Seneca offers more than an education. With campuses throughout the Greater Toronto Area,
              Seneca’s size and diversity give students the advantage of partnerships with industry leaders,
              the latest in hands-on computer technology, a variety of class sizes, and full-time, part-time
              and continuing education options. Education should be flexible and accessible,
              so Seneca also employs various methods of teaching – from in-class lectures and online learning to co-op
              and field placements – in programs related to applied arts, business, financial services and technology.
            </p>
            <h3>Academics</h3>
            <p>
              Seneca offers more than 145 full-time programs and 135 part-time programs including 14 Bachelor's degrees and 30 graduate certificates.
              Many programs offer experiential learning opportunities such as co-op, placements, internships and community service options,
              while others include a mandatory co-op period prior to graduation. Seneca also offers career search assistance to graduating students.
              Seneca College programs are developed and kept current with the assistance of advisory committees made up of key industry members.
              They are in place to ensure the education students receive provides the skills necessary for career success.
              Seneca College is the leader in Ontario in university and college pathways.

              including universities in Australia, England, South Africa and the U.S. These agreements allow students
